Understanding CI/CD: A DevOps Approach
1. What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery) is a DevOps practice that automates software development workflows to improve code quality, speed up deployments, and reduce manual errors.

Continuous Integration (CI)
Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository.
Automated tests are run to catch integration issues early.
Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI.
Continuous Deployment (CD)
Every successful CI build is automatically deployed to production.
Requires rigorous automated testing to prevent faulty releases.
Tools: Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Spinnaker, AWS CodeDeploy.
Continuous Delivery (CD)
Ensures every successful build is ready for manual or automated deployment.
Useful when regulatory or business approval is needed before production deployment.
Tools: CircleCI, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket Pipelines.
